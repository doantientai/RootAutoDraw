# RootAutoDraw
It is very simple to run RootAutoDraw. We will run it on Google Colaboratory which is free and only requires a Gmail account to be able to use.
First, go to this Colaboratory: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vK4R281YmL8AcE7KefxBUc72nclIrzuK?usp=sharing.

At the same time, follow this video for instruction: https://youtu.be/DLyUSksOkwI

Feel free to create issues for questions.
Thank you!
